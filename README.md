CCNA: Enterprise Networking, Security, and Automation course, was extremely elaborate and I learnt a wide range of foundational and advanced skills necessary to design, implement, and secure modern networks. Here's a breakdown:

1) Network Design: LAN and WAN architecture, VLANs, Inter-VLAN Routing, and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).
2) Routing Protocols: Configure OSPF, EIGRP, and RIP for dynamic routing.
3) IP Addressing: Master IPv4/IPv6 addressing, subnetting, CIDR, and VLSM.
4) Network Security: Implement ACLs, firewalls, NAT, VPNs, and AAA for secure access.
5) Wireless Networking: Wi-Fi standards and security protocols like WPA2/WPA3.
6) Network Automation: Introduction to automation with tools like Ansible, Python, and SDN.
7) Troubleshooting: Methodology and tools (Wireshark, Cisco Network Assistant) for diagnosing network issues.
8) Advanced Routing: Scaling networks with OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, and multicast routing.
9) IPv6 Deployment: Configuring IPv6 addressing and routing protocols (OSPFv3, EIGRP for IPv6).
10) Cloud Networking: Hybrid cloud integration and cloud security best practices.
